#QCEnabler
This mod provides assets (one prefab and two config files) and used the code that is shipped with the game to enable show a ingame debug console.

#Usage
-To open or close the console you press F11.
-The console is ready to open after the main menu is loaded.
-While ingame you might need to unlock the mouse. Opening the crafting or inventory menu should suffice.

Currently the command input functionalty is disabled. The way QC is scanning for the Commands in the loaded Assemblies throws Exceptions because of something with Mscorlib.
The only usage is ingame debugging through logs.

#Installation
Extract the zip. Into your Mods folder.
